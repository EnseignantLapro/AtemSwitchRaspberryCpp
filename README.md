# AtemSwitchRaspberryCpp
Portage of the https://github.com/kasperskaarhoj arduino Code To Raspberry C++ for ATEM Software Control 6.3


This code work but is instable. It's dependant on timming.
When atem switcher have no ping , he stop the connection and we stop the program.
We have to make a thread for ping UDP and reponse for a ping UDP ( its a protocol to atem 6.3)

The code work an compile on raspberry pi 3b+

I dont kown how we can take some keybord input....

On the TestAtem Program 
I change the video input every second. but if it lasts too long, we lose the connection


With this projet the id√©a is to take somme input signal to GPIO for control an Atem switcher .
